# Car-Price-Prediction

This repository contains the code and resources for a car price prediction project using various machine learning models. In this project, we have used five different models for predicting car prices: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and AdaBoost.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the prices of cars based on various features and attributes. The dataset used for this project contains information about different cars, including features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more.

## Data Description

![Data Description](data_description.png)

The dataset used for this project includes various attributes of cars, including type of carbody, enginetype, horsepower, mileage on highway as well as city, etc.

## Models Used

We have employed the following machine learning models for car price prediction:

1. **Linear Regression**: A basic linear model for regression analysis.
2. **Decision Tree**: A decision tree-based regression model.
3. **Random Forest**: An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees.
4. **XGBoost**: A gradient boosting algorithm known for its predictive power.
5. **AdaBoost**: Another ensemble model that combines weak learners to create a strong learner.

## Results
After assessing the models' performance on different metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2), it is concluded that that the Random Forest gives the best performance consistently throughout all the metrics.
